# Activity 2: Variables and Basic Math

## Problem Description

Learn how to use variables to store and manipulate data. Write a program that calculates and displays the sum of two numbers.

## Objectives

- Understand how to declare and use variables
- Perform basic arithmetic operations
- Display variable values

## Requirements

1. Create two variables: `num1` with value 5 and `num2` with value 10
2. Create a third variable `sum` that stores their sum
3. Print the result in the format: `The sum of 5 and 10 is 15`

## Expected Output

```
The sum of 5 and 10 is 15
```

## Examples

### Example 1
**Variables**: num1 = 5, num2 = 10
**Output**:
```
The sum of 5 and 10 is 15
```

### Example 2 (Try on your own)
**Variables**: num1 = 25, num2 = 17
**Output**:
```
The sum of 25 and 17 is 42
```

## Instructions

1. Open the starter file for your chosen language
2. Declare the variables num1 and num2
3. Calculate the sum
4. Print the result in the required format
5. Run your program to verify

## Tips

- Use string concatenation or formatted strings to create the output message
- Make sure the numbers and text are in the correct format
- Test with different values to ensure your code works correctly

## Language-Specific Notes

### JavaScript
- Use `let` or `const` to declare variables
- Use template literals (backticks) for easy string formatting: `\`The sum of ${num1} and ${num2} is ${sum}\``
- Or use string concatenation with `+`

### Python
- Variables don't need type declarations
- Use f-strings for formatting: `f"The sum of {num1} and {num2} is {sum}"`
- Or use `.format()` method

### Java
- Declare variable types explicitly: `int num1 = 5;`
- Use `System.out.println()` with string concatenation
- Or use `String.format()` for formatted output

## Next Steps

After completing this activity, you'll move on to learning about conditionals and user input.
